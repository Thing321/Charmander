                Like many pokemon, charmander is capable of evolving when they reach a certain level, charmander evolves into charmeleon at level 16. When charmander evolves they gain a more reddish appearence, large claws, a single horn on the back of their head and
                increased size, charmeleon is much more powerful and aggressive than charmander. Charmeleon evolves into charizard at level 36, when charmeleon evolves they gain large wings, their one horn becomes two and their size increases significantly
                along with their power, they lose their reddish color and revert back to orange.
